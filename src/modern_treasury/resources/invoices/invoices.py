          payment_effective_date: Date transactions are to be posted to the participants' account. Defaults to the
              current business day or the next business day if the current day is a bank
              holiday or weekend. Format: yyyy-mm-dd.

          payment_method: The method by which the invoice can be paid. `ui` will show the embedded payment
              collection flow. `automatic` will automatically initiate payment based upon the
              account details of the receiving_account id.\nIf the invoice amount is positive,
              the automatically initiated payment order's direction will be debit. If the
              invoice amount is negative, the automatically initiated payment order's
              direction will be credit. One of `manual`, `ui`, or `automatic`.

          payment_type: One of `ach`, `bankgirot`, `eft`, `wire`, `check`, `sen`, `book`, `rtp`, `sepa`,
              `bacs`, `au_becs`, `interac`, `neft`, `nics`, `nz_national_clearing_code`,
              `sic`, `signet`, `provexchange`, `zengin`.

          receiving_account_id: The receiving account ID. Can be an `external_account`.

          recipient_email: The email of the recipient of the invoice. Leaving this value as null will
              fallback to using the counterparty's name.

          recipient_name: The name of the recipient of the invoice. Leaving this value as null will
              fallback to using the counterparty's name.

          status: Invoice status must be updated in a `PATCH` request that does not modify any
              other invoice attributes. Valid state transitions are `draft` to `unpaid`,
              `draft` or `unpaid` to `voided`, and `draft` or `unpaid` to `paid`.

          virtual_account_id: The ID of the virtual account the invoice should be paid to.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

          idempotency_key: Specify a custom idempotency key for this request
